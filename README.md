# TrappingRainWater
Geek for Geeks problem

Given an array arr[] with non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If the width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4]
Output: 10
Explanation: 

Input: arr[] = [7, 4, 0, 9]
Output: 10
Explanation:
Water trapped by above 
block of height 4 is 3 units and above 
block of height 0 is 7 units. So, the 
total unit of water trapped is 10 units.

Input: arr[] = [6, 9, 9]
Output: 0
Explanation:
No water will be trapped.

Constraints:
3 < arr.size() < 10^4
0 < arr[i] < 10^3
